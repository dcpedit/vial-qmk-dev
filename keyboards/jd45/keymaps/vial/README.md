## Description

This keymap adds support for [Vial](https://get.vial.today) to the JD45.

## Caveats 

This firmware has only been tested on the [Phoenix 45](https://p3dstore.com/products/phoenix-pcb-only) PCB, which is a drop-in replacement for the original JD45 PCB. The Phoenix 45 uses the JD45 QMK config. Some of the configurations may not be supported on the JD45.

## TODO
* Add support for rotary encoders
* Create a more robust starting keymap
